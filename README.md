1. app.py
The heart of the app resides in app.py and helpers.py, where Flask decorators orchestrate the logic and functionality behind each page. Each decorator corresponds to a unique URL route, ensuring a smooth and coherent user experience:
- "/" - redirects users to login page if not logged in, otherwise displays book library
- "/register" - handles the user registrations process. Accepts GET and POST requests.
- "/login" - manages the user login process, accepts GET and POST requests. Get for - retrieving info, post for submitting info
- "/logout" - logs the user out and redirects to login form
- "/shelves" - displays books ordered by genre, in shelves
- "/add_book" - processes the addition of new books, accepts GET and POST requests
- "/edit_book" - allows editing specific books based on its ID, accepts GET and POST requests
- "/delete_book" - allows deletion of books based on book ID, accepts GET and POST requests
- "/book_library" - displays the entire book library
"/overview" - provides an overview of various statistics related to the user book collection
- "/contact" - displays the contact page
2. The app leverages the books.db SQL database, housing two pivotal tables:
Users: Stores username and password information for authentication.
Books: Manages book entries, allowing edits, deletions, and updates based on user actions. Each decorator within app.py integrates SQL queries tailored to the page's functionality, filtering and displaying only the user-submitted data via db.execute using user_id.
3. Javascript
JavaScript plays a pivotal role in managing form submissions, updating book lists via AJAX requests, and filtering displayed books by genre. Preventing default form submission behaviors, it facilitates seamless interactions with the /add_book endpoint, triggering updatebooklist() on successful submissions. This function extracts book data from /book_list, refreshing the displayed book list, and supporting genre-based filtering. It further enhances the user experience by providing edit and delete options for each book entry in the displayed table.
App.py will handle all the logic and functionality of
